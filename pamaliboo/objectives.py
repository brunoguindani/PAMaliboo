  Object representing a target function to be maximized.

  A suitable target function must be able to be executed by a script (even if
  not Python) which accepts command-line parameters, and must produce an output
  file which contains (possibly among other things) the function evaluation.
  This is because this library is thought for the optimization of programs
  which must be submitted to some scheduler in order to be executed. However,
  note that nearly any function can be implemented in this form.
  The objective can also have a discrete optimization domain. If so, it must be
  created as a .csv file, and its path must be passed to the constructor as the
  `domain_file` option.
